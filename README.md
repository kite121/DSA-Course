# Algorithms & Data Structures — Weekly Work (PDF + C++)

This repository contains my weekly work for an Algorithms & Data Structures course:
- **Problem sets** — solutions in **PDF**
- **Coding tasks** — typically **two C++ tasks per week**
- Weeks with exams / special weeks may not include problem sets or coding tasks.

## Topics covered
- Algorithm analysis, asymptotic notation
- Elementary data structures, amortized analysis
- Hashing (chaining vs open addressing)
- Divide-and-conquer, recurrences
- Dynamic programming
- Sorting (comparison-based + integer sorting)
- Trees: BST, randomized BST, Red-Black, AVL
- Priority queues, heaps, 2–3 trees, B-trees, heapsort
- Graphs: representations, BFS/DFS, topological sorting
- MST: Prim, Kruskal
- Shortest paths: Dijkstra, Bellman–Ford, Floyd–Warshall
- Flow networks: max flow, Ford–Fulkerson, min-cut

## Repository structure
Each week has its own folder inside `weeks/`:
- `problem-set/solution.pdf` — PDF solution for the weekly problem set
- `code/task-a.cpp` and `code/task-b.cpp` — C++ solutions for coding tasks (when applicable)
